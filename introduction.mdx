## Welcome to the Future of Subscriptions

Remember why you came to crypto? The freedom to transact globally without intermediaries, to control your own money, to build without permission.

Yet subscriptions still force you off-chain—moving funds to centralized platforms, paying unnecessary fees, giving up custody, and missing out on yield opportunities.

**We're bringing crypto's original promise back to subscriptions.**

Our protocol enables true on-chain recurring payments where users maintain full custody of their funds while earning yield on idle balances, and merchants accept crypto subscriptions without blockchain complexity.

  <Card title="For Users" icon="wallet" iconType="duotone">
    Subscribe to services while keeping custody of your funds and earning yield on idle balances
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Merchants" icon="store" iconType="duotone">
    Accept recurring crypto payments with a simple API—no blockchain knowledge required
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why This Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Full Custody" iconType="duotone">
    Your funds never leave the blockchain. They stay in your subscription wallet (a PDA you control), not in some company's custody. Cancel anytime and your funds remain yours—no refund requests, no waiting periods.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="chart-line-up" title="Earn While You Wait" iconType="duotone">
    Idle subscription funds automatically generate yield through integrated DeFi protocols (Marginfi, Kamino, Solend, Drift). Your Netflix payment can earn 5-8% APY while waiting for next month's charge.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="globe" title="Global from Day One" iconType="duotone">
    Accept or make payments from anyone, anywhere, instantly. No payment processor fees, no chargebacks, no failed transactions due to expired cards.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Simple Integration" iconType="duotone">
    Merchants integrate in minutes using our REST API and SDK—no Solana knowledge required. We abstract all blockchain complexity so you can focus on your business.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Users Create Subscription Wallets">
    Connect your Solana wallet and create a subscription wallet (PDA) in one click. Deposit funds and optionally enable yield earning on idle balances.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Subscribe to Services">
    Browse available subscription plans and subscribe with one click. The protocol automatically reserves a buffer (typically 3 months) while the rest keeps earning yield.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Payments">
    Smart contracts execute payments on schedule—no manual intervention needed. Users maintain full visibility and control through their dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Merchants Receive Payments">
    Funds flow directly to merchant wallets on-chain. No intermediaries, no custody risk, no payment processor fees.
  </Step>
</Steps>
