## What is Eventop?

Eventop is a drop-in SDK that adds AI-guided tours to your React or Next.js app. Wrap any element with `<EventopTarget>` — the AI handles the rest. When a user types what they need in the chat bubble, the SDK figures out which features are relevant, navigates to the right pages, and walks them through step by step.

No changes to your existing components. Works with any component library.

```jsx
<EventopTarget id="export" name="Export Design" description="Download as PNG or SVG">
  <Button onClick={handleExport}>Export</Button>
</EventopTarget>
```

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a server endpoint">
    Proxy the AI call from your backend so API keys never reach the browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the provider">
    Wrap your app with `<EventopAIProvider>` and pass your server route and router function.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wrap your features">
    Add `<EventopTarget>` around any UI element you want the AI to be able to guide users to.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The chat bubble appears automatically. Users type what they want, and the tour runs — including navigating between pages when needed.

## Key features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cross-page navigation" icon="map">
    Tours navigate between pages automatically. Before starting, the chat panel tells users which pages will be visited. No manual navigation code needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-step flows" icon="list-ol">
    Use `<EventopStep>` to break complex interactions into sequential steps. Steps can live in completely different components — they self-assemble by index.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Async validation" icon="circle-check">
    Block a tour from advancing until the user correctly completes a form action. Use `stepComplete()` and `stepFail()` from the `useEventopAI` hook.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Themeable" icon="palette">
    Customize colors, radius, and fonts with theme tokens. Supports light, dark, and auto modes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Framework agnostic wrapping" icon="puzzle-piece">
    `<EventopTarget>` wraps anything — `<div>`, shadcn, MUI, Radix, or your own components. You never modify the component itself.
  </Accordion>
