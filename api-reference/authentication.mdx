## API Keys

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Create API Key">
    Choose a descriptive name and select the environment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Your Key">

## Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.eventop.xyz/checkout/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_abc123..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "planId": "premium-monthly",
    "customerEmail": "user@example.com",
    "successUrl": "https://yourdomain.com/success"
  }'
```
```javascript Node.js
const eventop = require('@eventop/sdk');

const client = new eventop({
  apiKey: process.env.EVENTOP_API_KEY
});
```

</CodeGroup>

---

## Environment Variables

Store API keys in environment variables:

<CodeGroup>
```bash .env
# Devnet (testing)
EVENTOP_API_KEY=sk_test_abc123...

# Mainnet (production)
# EVENTOP_API_KEY=sk_live_xyz789...

# Webhook secret (from dashboard)
EVENTOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_abc123...

# Your merchant wallet
MERCHANT_WALLET=7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU
```
```javascript Node.js
require('dotenv').config();

const apiKey = process.env.EVENTOP_API_KEY;
```

</CodeGroup>

## Key Management

### Rotating Keys

Rotate your API keys periodically for security:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Generate a new API key in the dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Your Code">
    Deploy your application with the new key
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Operation">
    Confirm everything works with the new key
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Revoke Old Key">
    Delete the old key from the dashboard
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Revoking Compromised Keys

If an API key is compromised:

1. **Immediately revoke it** in the dashboard
2. **Create a new key** with a different name
3. **Update your application** with the new key
4. **Review recent activity** for suspicious requests

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables" icon="shield-check">
    Never hardcode API keys in your source code. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Separate Test and Live Keys" icon="split">
    Use different keys for development and production. Never use live keys in testing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Restrict Key Permissions" icon="lock">
    Create separate keys for different purposes (e.g., one for checkouts, one for webhooks).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Key Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Check the "Last Used" timestamp in the dashboard to detect unauthorized usage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly" icon="rotate">
    Rotate API keys every 90 days as a security best practice.
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Problem**: Your API key is invalid or expired.
    
    **Solution**:
    - Verify the key is correct (check for typos)
    - Ensure you're using the right key for the environment
    - Check if the key has been revoked in the dashboard
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Environment Mismatch" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Problem**: Using a test key on mainnet URLs or vice versa.
    
    **Solution**:
    - Test keys (`sk_test_...`) only work with `api-devnet.eventop.xyz`
    - Live keys (`sk_live_...`) only work with `api.eventop.xyz`
    - Let the SDK auto-detect the environment from your key prefix
