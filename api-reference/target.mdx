title: "EventopTarget"
description: "Props reference for the feature wrapper component."
---

```jsx
import { EventopTarget } from '@eventop/sdk/react';
```

Wrap any element with `<EventopTarget>` to register it as a feature the AI can guide users to. The wrapped component is unchanged — you never modify the component itself.

## Props

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  A stable, unique identifier for this feature. Used internally to track the feature across page navigations.

  <Warning>
    Use an ID that identifies a **UI capability**, not a data record. Avoid dynamic IDs like `` `project-${p.id}` `` — each unique ID creates a ghost entry that persists for the session. Use a single `EventopTarget` for repeating patterns instead.
  </Warning>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  A human-readable name for this feature. The AI reads this to understand what the feature does and match it to user intent.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="description" type="string">
  A short description of what this feature does. The more descriptive, the better the AI can match user queries to the right feature.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="route" type="string">
  The pathname where this feature lives (e.g. `"/settings/billing"`). When set, the SDK automatically navigates here before showing this step during a tour.

  Only required for features that live on a different page than where tours are typically started.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="advanceOn" type="object">
  Auto-advance the tour when an event fires.

  ```jsx
  advanceOn={{ event: 'click', delay: 300 }}
  // or target a specific child
  advanceOn={{ selector: '.submit-btn', event: 'click', delay: 200 }}
  ```

  | Field      | Type   | Description |
  |------------|--------|-------------|
  | `event`    | string | DOM event name (e.g. `'click'`, `'change'`) |
  | `delay`    | number | Milliseconds to wait after the event before advancing |
  | `selector` | string | CSS selector for the element to listen on. Defaults to the wrapped element. |
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="waitFor" type="string">
  A CSS selector the SDK waits to appear in the DOM before showing this step. Useful when the feature is conditionally rendered.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="navigate" type="function">
  **Legacy.** A function to call for navigation if the component is not mounted. Prefer `route` + `router` for React/Next.js apps.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="navigateWaitFor" type="string">
  **Legacy.** A CSS selector to wait for after calling `navigate`. Used alongside the legacy `navigate` prop.
</ParamField>
