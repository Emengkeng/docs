## Why Accept Crypto Subscriptions?

Traditional payment processors charge 2-3% fees, hold your funds, and can freeze your account without notice. With on-chain subscriptions, you get:

    Payments flow directly to your wallet—no waiting 7 days for transfers
  </Card>
  <Card title="Global by Default" icon="globe" iconType="duotone">
    Accept payments from anywhere without payment processor restrictions
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Chargebacks" icon="shield-check" iconType="duotone">
    Blockchain transactions are final—no fraudulent chargeback losses
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lower Fees" icon="coins" iconType="duotone">
    Just blockchain transaction costs (typically \<$0.01 on Solana)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works for Merchants

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Account">
    Sign up at [dashboard.eventop.xyz](https://dashboard.eventop.xyz) and create your merchant profile
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Subscription Plans">
    Define your pricing, billing interval, and plan details through the dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Integrate Checkout">
    Add our checkout flow to your website with just a few lines of code
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive Webhooks">
    Get notified when subscriptions are created, paid, or cancelled
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **No Blockchain Knowledge Required**
  
  Our API abstracts all blockchain complexity. You don't need to understand PDAs, Solana programs, or wallet connections.
</Note>

## Integration Pattern

Here's how your users will subscribe:
```
Your Website → Our Checkout Page → User's Mobile App → Back to Your Website
```

### Why This Flow?

Users need a **Solana wallet** and a **subscription wallet PDA** to use our protocol. Rather than forcing you to integrate complex wallet logic, we:

1. Host the checkout page (so users can download our app if needed)
2. Handle wallet creation automatically in our mobile app
3. Process the on-chain subscription transaction
4. Redirect back to your site with success/failure status

**You just redirect to our checkout URL—we handle everything else.**

## What You Need

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Merchant Wallet" icon="wallet">
    A Solana wallet address where you'll receive payments (we can help you create one)
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Key" icon="key">
    Generated in the merchant dashboard for authenticating API requests
  </Card>
  <Card title="Webhook Endpoint" icon="webhook">
    A URL on your server to receive event notifications (optional but recommended)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Success/Cancel URLs" icon="link">
    Where users return after completing or cancelling checkout
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Server-Side Redirect (Recommended)

Create checkout sessions on your backend and redirect users:
```javascript
// Your backend
const session = await eventop.checkout.create({
  planId: 'premium-monthly',
  customerEmail: user.email,
  successUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/success',
  cancelUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/pricing'
});

// Redirect to our checkout page
res.redirect(session.url);
```

**Best for**: Most use cases. Works with any programming language.

### Option 2: Client-Side URL Generation

Build checkout URLs directly in your frontend:
```html
<a href="https://checkout.eventop.xyz/create?
  merchant=YOUR_WALLET&
  plan=premium-monthly&
  email=user@example.com&
  success_url=https://yourdomain.com/success&
  cancel_url=https://yourdomain.com/pricing">
  Subscribe Now
</a>
```

**Best for**: Simple integrations, WordPress sites, no-code tools.

### Option 3: Platform-Specific Plugins

We provide ready-made plugins for popular platforms:

- **WordPress/WooCommerce** - Install our plugin and configure
- **Shopify** - Add our app from the Shopify App Store
- **Webflow** - Embed our widget with custom code

<Info>
  Platform plugins are coming soon. For now, use Options 1 or 2.

## Customer Identity

When a user subscribes through our checkout, you receive their:

- **Email address** (that you passed to us)
- **Wallet address** (their Solana wallet)
- **Subscription ID** (on-chain identifier)

This allows you to:
- Send receipts and notifications
- Match subscriptions to your internal user accounts
- Track customer lifetime value

  <Step title="User Subscribes">
