## Smart Contract Overview

Our protocol is built on Solana using Anchor framework. Here are the core instructions:

### User Instructions

- `create_subscription_wallet` - Create your subscription wallet (PDA)
- `deposit_to_wallet` - Add funds to your wallet
- `enable_yield` - Start earning yield on idle funds
- `subscribe_with_wallet` - Subscribe to a merchant's plan
- `withdraw_from_wallet` - Withdraw available funds
- `cancel_subscription_wallet` - Cancel active subscriptions
- `claim_yield_rewards` - Claim accumulated yield earnings

### Merchant Instructions

- `register_merchant` - Create a subscription plan
- `execute_payment_from_wallet` - Process scheduled payments

<Note>
  Detailed smart contract documentation, account structures, and integration examples coming soon.
